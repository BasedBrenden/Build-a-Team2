# Build-A-Team

This is a fun full-stack project created by Brenden Thomas that allows you to securely create and save your own 6 monster pokemon team! Create an account and get started building today!

## Motivation

This project originally started off as a simple PokeDex app. I wanted to challenge my self to see how much I could actually flesh out a project on my own to be actually useful. 

While browsing different iterations of pokedex sites, i noticed that there wasn't a reliably way to:

1. Build a Custom Pokemon Team and have it be saved for quick access via the cloud
2. Quickly be able to see the types, type advantage and type weaknesses of the individual Pokemon in a premade team.

## Features

With the current iteration of Build-A-Team, you can do the following:

 - Create and Sign into a secure account via an email address (real or fake if you'd like to just test the app out).
 - Search by name from a list of 721 Pokemon (Gen I - Gen VI).
 - Add and remove Pokemon from a 6 monster roster that is saved to a cloud database.
 - Access your personal team by signing into your account through Desktop and Mobile browsers.
 - See individual Pokemon's abilities and type match ups.


## How To Use?

Create a new account to begin searching for Pokemon to add to your team! Add or remove the Pokemon from your team by selecting the "+" or "x" button next the corresponding monster. See a detailed summary of the potential abilities the pokemon could have by clicking on the corresponding ability under the "Abilities" section.
