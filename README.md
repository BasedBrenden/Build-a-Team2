A full-stack web app by Brenden Thomas that lets users build and manage a custom 6-Pok√©mon team. Features include secure authentication, persistent team storage, and a downloadable team image generator for printing on items like debit or credit cards.

## Motivation

This project originally started off as a simple PokeDex app. I wanted to challenge my self to see how much I could actually flesh out a project on my own to be actually useful. 

While browsing different iterations of pokedex sites, i noticed that there wasn't a reliably way to:

1. Build a Custom Pokemon Team and have it be saved for quick access via the cloud
2. Quickly be able to see the types, type advantage and type weaknesses of the individual Pokemon in a premade team.
3. An option to make the teams more real by bringing nostalgic teams with you to the real world.

## Features

With the current iteration of Build-A-Team, you can do the following:

 - Create and Sign into a secure account via an email address (real or fake if you'd like to just test the app out).
 - Search by name from a list of 721 Pokemon (Gen I - Gen VI).
 - Add and remove Pokemon from a 6 monster roster that is saved to a cloud database.
 - Access your personal team by signing into your account through Desktop and Mobile browsers.
 - See individual Pokemon's abilities and type match ups.
 - Download a version of your very own trainer card, for use as a custome credit card background!
### Coming soon
 
Safari Mode
  - Works just like Safari Mode in the original game! Encounter a new random set of pokemon everyday. Throw rocks to keep them from running away, throw bait to increase your chances to catch them, and throw PokeBalls to catch and store pokemon in your PC to later make a full team with!
  - Throw too many rocks? Pokemon has a chance to get angry and scare you, causing you to drop items
  - PokeBalls and Bait will be replenished every day. Once they are used up, trainers will have to wait until the next daily reset to catch Pokemon or give Bait
